VACCINATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Introduction
Due to Covid-19 outbreak people start to find the way to fight this pandemic like isolation of people and stopping people to travel from one place to other and other decision made by same state to protect their citizen before they find the vaccine. After a while the vaccine was found like Oxford–AstraZeneca, Sinopharm BIBP, Moderna, Janssen, CoronaVac, Covaxin, Novavax and others. Countries start vaccination process to their citizens in same state every citizen he/she must have something that shows that he got all vaccines doses. Government will need system to help in generating certificate to the citizens that shows that they take the doses of vaccines and how many.
Problems
1.	Data are easily lost because there is no best way to keep data safe  
2.	Lack of storage space using papers take big space to keep
3.	Updating problems: It is not easy to change or update data on papers
4.	High cost due to the use of printers while printing documents using of papers
  
Solution
1.	Cost Reduction: This system will reduce the cost spent on registering people who take vaccine because they use papers and many employees
2.	Saving of time: This system save time which was taken to register and check vaccine while checking and registration of vaccination.
3.	Portability: This system will be portable so that you can do everything in any were you are.
4.	Increase Profitability: this will increase performance and productivity with a reduction of costs and resources.  
5.	Protection of data: this will keep data safe and secure and it will be easy to search and select for data you need.

Development:

While developing we ‘ve used both back-end and font-end and database system and few libraries
Requirements : PC, Network and Jdk
Font-end : Java with Net beans  v8  
Back-end : Java with Net beans v8
DBMS: Xampp
Libraries : java-mysql-connecter

Testing

While Development we met with many errors. So we used some approach of testing like:

-Unit Test
-Integration Test
-Function testing
-End-to-end test
-Acceptance test

We have found errors while developing this system and we have fixed it and on each step we find mistakes and some feature to add and we have correct them.
   
Performance test will be the last one 

Deployment

Deployment of our system will continue after it is accepted all requirements are prepared it is ready to be deployed. Our system will be responsive in all devices like personal computeror Desktops.
After it is accepted we will proceed with processes of deployment and it will be used all over the country.
